        <meta name="description" content="John and George did a full renovation on my bathroom and what a fantastic job they did. Couldn’t fault them in anyway. They got in and got the job done in great time. The price was very reasonable no mess all clean when left. I would highly recommend them to anyone. I’m very happy with my bathroom.">
